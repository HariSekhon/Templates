    # VM - technically a docker image is a better choice than machine due to faster spin-up and less resources (credits/cost)
    #    - use if you need:
    #      - larger RAM (can go to roughly double)
    #      - full OS access (network stack, sysctl etc)
    #      - docker-compose mounts
    #      - some native environment variation between build systems in order to test the repo's build automation is robust
