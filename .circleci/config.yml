version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    # technically a docker image is a better choice than machine
    # but we want to introduce some native environment variation
    # between build systems in order to test the repo's build automation is robust
    machine:
      image: default
      #image: ubuntu-1604:201903-01
      # set to an actual docker image when running locally using circle_ci_job.sh
      # docker image must have git installed to do the checkout
      # so using harisekhon/dev:ubuntu instead of base ubuntu image
      #image: harisekhon/dev:ubuntu
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: setup/ci_bootstrap.sh
      - run: make init
      - run: make
      # to allow docker networking to work
      - run: sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
      - run: sudo service docker restart
      - run: make test
