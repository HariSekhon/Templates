# Good in theory, to alert on PR changes to these code paths, but for public repos which may be forked and run .github/workflows/fork-update.yaml, this will result in a lot of spam

# Tips:
#
# * includes changes under .github/
# dir/* only matches first level file changes but doesn't recurse
# dir/ recurses
#
# - CODEOWNERS in base branch of PR determines review request
# - paths are case sensitive
# - last match wins, use * at top for overall owner then override with more specific teams
# - teams must have write access and not be secret

#*          @harisekhon                  # username or email address
#*          @myorg/platform-engineering  # team based is the way to go - team must have Write access to the repo regardless of if individuals have access
#*          @myorg/devops
#k8s        @myorg/devops @myorg/sre-team
#apps/      @myorg/developers
#apps/dir2  # ignores dir2 as no owner/team specified on this line
